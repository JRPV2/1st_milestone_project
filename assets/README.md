# Just CHess-ting!

Welcome to Just chess-ting, a club comprised of people, and for people who enjoy the game of chess, and want to play at a social level.

In order for the stereo type of the chess player being a "person of a certain age" sitting alone studying dry old books or playing a fellow geriatric in a nursing home, we need to bring chess out into the open, literally in our case, for all to see.
Then, and only then, in our opinions, can peoples perception of the game change for the better.

## Features

### Navigation and header
* At the top of the page, within the header, sits the nav bar, consistent across all pages.

* The anchor elements change colour scheme when the user is on that particular page or when hovered over, and a differentiating border is created, should the hovered over anchor be adjacent to the current page anchor.

* The navigation is clear and intuitive.

### Why chess
    
* This section provides an overveiw of the benefits of playing chess and is laid out in such a way so as not to overwhelm the user with too much text or detail to take in.

### Puzzles
    
* This section provides 6 easier puzzles, 2 of mate in 1, 2 & 3. Then 2 harder puzzles to strech and challnge.
    
* When the mouse is hovered over the text, the solution is revealed.

### Contact

* The contact section has a sign-up form for prospective chess players to submit their details should they wish.

* This is valuable to the user as it gives them the opportunity to get in touch with the club.

## Testing

* I confirmed that the project is responsive, looks good (to me at any rate) on various screen widths using devtools.

* Conformed that the nav bar works as expected

* I have confirmed that the form works and the text contast makes the text easy to read.

### Bugs

* No serious bugs were found, only some positions of images and text which were originally not what was intended aesthetically were the main cause of editing code before submission.

### Validator Testing

* HTML
    * No errors were returned when checking all HTML files code using W3C validator.

* CSS
    * No errors were found when checking style.css using Jigsaw validator.

* Accessibilty
    * I confirmed that the colors and fonts are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse in devtools.

## Deployment

* The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
    * In the GitHub repository, navigate to the settings tab.
    * From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch.
    * Once the master branch has been selected, the page provided the link to the 'completed' website.

The live link can not be found here as I don't know which link to put here! (This part of the course was not well covered in my opinion!)

## Credits

* The code to make the social media links was taken from the CI Love running project

* The images for the easier an harder chess puzzles were taken from https://chesspuzzles.com and https://chess.com respectively.

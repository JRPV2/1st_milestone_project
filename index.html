            Why Chess?

                Chess poem:
                She moves him round the chess board, dodging bishops, pawns and rooks. She coaxes him from square to square without a second look. The white knight cannot catch him. Piece by piece, the foe now yields. Her king is safe; the game is done. The queen controls the field.

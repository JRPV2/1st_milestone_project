                She moves him round the chess board, 
                dodging bishops, pawns and rooks. 
                She coaxes him from square to square 
                without a second look. 
                The white knight cannot catch him. 
                Piece by piece, the foe now yields. 
                Her king is safe; the game is done. 
                The queen controls the field.
